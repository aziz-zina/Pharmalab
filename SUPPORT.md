# Support and Help

Need help with PharmaLab? Here's how you can get assistance.

## How to Get Help

We encourage you to seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Documentation and Guides:** Explore the project's documentation and guides located in the `docs/` directory to find answers to common questions.

2. :bulb: **Stack Overflow:** For general usage questions not specific to the project itself, ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). This helps you find quick solutions and benefits others with similar queries.

3. :memo: **GitHub Issues (Last Resort):** If you can't find an answer elsewhere, open a GitHub issue as a last resort. Clearly explain your goal, list attempted solutions, and provide code samples. **Do not** attach your entire project for debugging. Review our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What NOT to Do

Please avoid the following:

1. :x: **Social Media:** Do not reach out on social media platforms like Twitter or via email.

2. :x: **Duplicate Issues:** Avoid opening duplicate issues or adding +1's to existing issues. Follow the guidelines mentioned above for GitHub issues.

## Customer Support

We do not provide traditional "customer support" for open-source projects. However, for contracting and consulting opportunities, you can explore [hire-me](https://www.jessesquires.com/hire-me/).

Remember, public questions benefit the entire community. Thank you for being part of the PharmaLab community! üåê‚ú®
