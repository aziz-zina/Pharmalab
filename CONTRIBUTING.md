# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to PharmaLab! Your contributions are highly valued. Whether you're fixing a bug, proposing a new feature, or suggesting improvements, your involvement makes PharmaLab better. 🚀

## 📖 Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It ensures a positive and inclusive environment for everyone. Kindly adhere to it at all times.

## 💡 Asking Questions

For general inquiries, consult our [Support Guide](SUPPORT.md). If you have specific questions or need assistance, GitHub issues are not the place. Please use the appropriate channels outlined in the guide.

## 📥 Opening an Issue

Before creating an issue, ensure you are using the latest project version. If not, update and check if the issue persists.

### 🔒 Reporting Security Issues

For security vulnerabilities, refer to our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md). Do not disclose security issues publicly; follow the guidelines in the policy.

### 🐞 Bug Reports and Other Issues

Submitting well-documented bug reports is appreciated. Follow these guidelines:

- Avoid duplicates; search existing issues first.
- Complete the provided issue template thoroughly.
- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown for readability.
- Include relevant details such as steps to reproduce, stack traces, and screenshots.

## 💌 Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

- Avoid duplicates; search for existing requests.
- Provide a clear outcome and relate it to existing features.
- Include implementation details if possible. 🛠️

## 🔍 Triaging Issues

Help triage issues by reproducing bugs or requesting additional information. Your assistance is valuable in resolving issues promptly.

## 🔁 Submitting Pull Requests

We love pull requests! Follow these guidelines:

- Open an issue before non-trivial changes.
- For smaller changes, one pull request per fix or feature.
- Coordinate larger changes with maintainers.
- Prioritize understanding over cleverness.
- Follow coding style and conventions.
- Include test coverage.
- Update documentation and the CHANGELOG.
- Branch from and submit pull requests to the default branch.
- Resolve merge conflicts promptly. 🤝

## 📝 Writing Commit Messages

Please write clear and concise commit messages:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Capitalize the subject line and use imperative mood.
- Wrap the body at about 72 characters.
- Explain the problem and solution in the body.
- Use tags like "[Docs]" for specific components.
- Reference related GitHub issues.

## ✅ Code Review

Review the code, not the author. Look for and suggest improvements without disparaging or insulting the author. Provide actionable feedback and explain your reasoning.

-You are not your code. When your code is critiqued, questioned, or constructively criticized, remember that you are not your code. Do not take code review personally.
-Always do your best. No one writes bugs on purpose. Do your best, and learn from your mistakes.
-Kindly note any violations to the guidelines specified in this document.

## 💅 Coding Style

Consistency is crucial. Follow existing style, formatting, and naming conventions. Failure to do so will extend the review process.

## 🏅 Certificate of Origin

Before contributing, certify that your contribution adheres to the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1. Ensure you have the right to submit the work under the project's open-source license.

## No Brown M&M's

If you've read this far, you're amazing! To confirm, include 🖤 :black_heart: at the top of your issue or pull request.
